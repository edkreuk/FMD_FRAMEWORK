## Introduction FMD_FRAMEWORK

Fabric Metadata-Driven Framework (FMD)

Efficient data management is a cornerstone of modern organizations, and leveraging the right tools can make all the difference. The Fabric Metadata-Driven Framework (FMD) is a cutting-edge solution designed to optimize data handling and utilization. This innovative framework harnesses the powerful capabilities of the Fabric SQL Database to build a robust, scalable, and flexible metadata-driven architecture.

Key Features:

-**Enhanced Data Governance:** FMD ensures comprehensive data governance by maintaining detailed metadata, enabling better data quality, consistency, and compliance.

-**Scalability and Flexibility:** 
The framework is designed to scale seamlessly with your organization's growth, adapting to evolving data needs without compromising performance.

-**Streamlined Data Integration:** FMD simplifies the integration of diverse data sources, providing a unified view of your data landscape.

-**Cost Efficiency:** By optimizing data processes and reducing redundancy, FMD helps organizations achieve significant cost savings.


## FMD_FRAMEWORK Deployment

### Requirements

The admin settings below needs to be enabled:
- Users can create Fabric items
- SQL database (preview)â€‹


The following steps need to be done:

### 1. Download Files

Download the three files 
- FMD_deployment.json : Contains all definitions to create all artifacts for the FMD_FRAMEWORK (Input for the notebook below)
- NB_FMD_DEPLOYMENT_MULTI_ENV.ipynb : Creates all artifacts for the FMD_FRAMEWORK within Fabric Data Platform(baed on your configuration)
- NB_FMD_DEPLOYMENT_UTILS.ipynb: Contains all definition to Creates all artifacts
to your local machine.

or 

- Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edkreuk/FMD_FRAMEWORK.git
   ```

### 3. Create Connection

Create the following two connections and Write down the Connection ID for later usage.:


| | |
| -------------| ------------- |
|Connection Name | CON_FMD_FABRIC_API  |
|Connection Type|  Web v2  |
|Base Url  | https://api.fabric.microsoft.com/v1/  |
|Token Audience Url|https://api.fabric.microsoft.com|
|Authentification|OAuth2|
|-|-|
|Connection Name| CON_FMD_FABRICPIPELINES  |
|Connection Type|  Fabric Data Pipelines|
|Authentification|OAuth2|
|-|-|
|Connection Name| CON_FMD_FABRICSQL  |
|Connection Type|  Fabric SQL database|
|Authentification|OAuth2|


### 4. Create Workspace and Config Lakehouse

- Create a new workspace "FMD_FRAMEWORK_CONFIGURATION" (Name is up to you)
- Create a new SQL database "SQL_FMD_FRAMEWORK" in this workspace. (Note: Currently there is no API available to create this automatically)
  
![create_sql_database](/Images/FMD_create_sql_database.png)
  
- Create a new Lakehouse called "LH_CONFIGURATION"
    - Do not enable schema
    - Within the files section, create a subfolder named "deployment"
    - Upload the file "FMD_deployment.json" to the new folder

![deployment_file](/Images/FMD_add_deployment_file.png)

- Import Notebooks (NB: Make sure your are in the Fabric Experience)
    - Import the notebook "NB_FMD_DEPLOYMENT_MULTI_ENV.ipynb" into the workspace
    - Import the notebook "NB_FMD_DEPLOYMENT_UTILS.ipynb" into the workspace

![Fabric Experience](/Images/FMD_Fabric_Experience.png)

### 6. Notebook Configuration

Deployment Configuration Script
This script is used to configure deployment settings for different environments (development and production) in a Fabric SQL Framework. Below is a detailed explanation of each section of the script.

Open the notebook NB_FMD_DEPLOYMENT_MULTI_ENV and scroll to the second cell. This is the deployment configuration.

1. Capacity ID
capacity_id = '075e5656-1234-5678-a36c8c0e8bca'
Purpose: Unique identifier for the capacity to be used.

1. Workspace Roles
Purpose: Defines roles (or keep empty []) to be added to the workspace. Each role includes:
principal: The group or user to which the role is assigned.
role: The role assigned to the principal (e.g., Member, Admin

	Example with roles:

		```
		workspace_roles = [
			{
				"principal": {
					"id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
					"displayName": "sg-fabric-contributor",
					"type": "Group"
				},
				"role": "Member"
			},
			{
				"principal": {
					"id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
					"displayName": "sg-fabric-admin",
					"type": "Group"
				},
				"role": "Admin"
			}
		]```
		
	Example without roles:

		```
		workspace_roles = []
		```

1. Logging settings. 
Purpose: Defines the configuration for the logging items. This can be a different workspace or the same workspace as of the following items. 
If you wan't you can change the default workspace name and warehousename

1. Configuration settings. 
Purpose: Defines the configuration for the Configuration items. This can be a different workspace or the same workspace for the other items. 
If you wan't you can change the default workspace name and databasename (database is already created in a previous step)
	
1. Environments. 
Purpose: Defines configurations for different environments (development and production). Each environment includes:
    - environment_name: Name of the environment.
    - workspaces: Workspaces for data and code, each with:
		- name: Name of the workspace.
		- roles: Roles to be assigned.
		- capacity_id: Capacity ID to be used.
connections: Various connection identifiers for the environment.
    - CON_FMD_FSQL (is created in a earlier stage): fill in the guid
    - CON_FMD_API_FABRIC (is created in a earlier stage): fill in the guid
    - CON_FMD_FABRICPIPELINES (is created in a earlier stage): fill in the guid
    - CON_FMD_ASQL_01: Optional connection. Used if you want to connect to an Azure SQL database (default: None)
    - CON_FMD_ASQL_02: optional connection. Used if you want to connect to an second Azure SQL database (default: None)
    - CON_FMD_ADLS_02: optional connection. Used if you want to connect to an Azure Datalake storage (default: None)
    - CON_FMD_ADF_PIPELINES: optional connection. Used if you want to run an Azure Datafactory Pipeline (default: None)
